# Hi, My name is Silvano Ross
I am relatively new to the programming field and am excited to learn as much as possible. 
Learning to program was more of a pipe dream in college as I was taking a multitude of science courses.
Finally, after trying to convince employers to teach me coding on the job I ended up enrolling independently in 
a few foundation courses for programming and databases. I plan on continuing in the world of coding and tech expanding
my knoweldge whenever and wherever I am able. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are new points of interest after 
having finally learned rudimentary python and SQL programming techniques.
