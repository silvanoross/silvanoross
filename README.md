# Hi, My name is Silvano Ross
I am relatively new to the programming field and am excited to learn as much as possible. 
Learning to program was a far off dream in college as I was taking a multitude of science courses.
Finally, I took the plunge enrolling in foundation courses for python and databases coded in SQL. I plan on continuing in the world of coding and tech expanding
my knoweldge whenever and wherever I am able. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are new points of interest after 
having finally learned rudimentary coding techniques. Additionally, I find the developing world of blockchain and web3 incredibly attention grabbing.
