## Summary

I am passionate and eager to learn to learn as much as possible in big data and tech. Learning to program was a far off dream in college as I was taking a multitude of science courses. Finally, I took the plunge enrolling in foundation courses for python and databases coded in SQL. I plan on continuing in the world of coding and tech expanding my knowledge whenever and wherever possible. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are new points of interest after having finally learned object-oriented programming. Additionally, I find the developing world of blockchain and web3 incredibly attention grabbing. I am currently enrolled in the UW FinTech certificate program which touches on all of my areas of interest. I hope to start in a role as a Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Analyst. My previous experience in research and clinical labs has prepared me for the various kinds of data analyst roles in tech.
