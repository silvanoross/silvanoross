# Hi, My name is Silvano Ross

I am relatively new to the programming field and am excited to learn as much as possible. 
Learning to program was a far off dream in college as I was taking a multitude of science courses.
Finally, I took the plunge enrolling in foundation courses for python and databases coded in SQL. I plan on continuing in the world of coding and tech expanding
my knoweldge whenever and wherever I am able. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are new points of interest after 
having finally learned rudimentary coding techniques. Additionally, I find the developing world of blockchain and web3 incredibly attention grabbing. I am currently enrolled in the [UW FinTech Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.uw.edu/fintech/landing-b5a/?s=Google-Brand&pkw=%2Buw%20%2Bfintech&pcrid=479786454847&pmt=b&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CUNIVERSITY-OF-WASHINGTON%7CSEM%7CFINTECH%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CBRD%7CBMM%7CCore%7CGeneral&utm_term=%2Buw%20%2Bfintech&s=google&k=%2Buw%20%2Bfintech&utm_adgroupid=111256639874&utm_locationphysicalms=9033311&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=479786454847&utm_placement=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxIOXBhCrARIsAL1QFCY6F3BHuf4V0jBNzwQ3vnrKpy5v27rwOsDz-ZGeVMvMXJm7cRe928gaAt00EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) which touches on all of my areas of interest.
