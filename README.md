## Summary

I am passionate and eager to learn to learn as much as possible in big data and tech. Learning to program was a far off dream in college as I was taking a multitude of science courses. Finally, I took the plunge enrolling in foundation courses for python and databases coded in SQL. I plan on continuing in the world of coding and tech expanding my knowledge whenever and wherever possible. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are new points of interest after having finally learned object-oriented programming. Additionally, I find the developing world of blockchain and web3 incredibly attention grabbing. I have received a certificate in fintech from the University of Washington and am enrolled to start a certificate in Data Science in the spring of 2023. A dream of mine is to be admitted to the residency program at OpenAI as a research scientist.
